description: "Full analog, semi modular (!), patchable synthesizer. It is an interface that works in conjunction with open source voice card."
notes: "Voice card specs
- Single oscillator with saw, triangle and pulse output
- Multiple VCAs to blend between different input signals, a main VCA for the envelope and a panning VCA for stereo output
- An additional external input that can be mixed in, eg. a noise signal
- One envelope generator for the VCA. It can modulate filter frequency and resonance, also with an inverted signal
- A pole-mixing multimode filter with 8 filter responses:
    - 4P LP
    - 2P LP
    - 4P HP
    - 2P HP
    - 4P BP
    - 2P BP
    - 3P AP + 1P LP
    - 4P N
- There are multiple options two switch and blend between different signals and filter responses
- PWM, FM and synchronisation inputs
