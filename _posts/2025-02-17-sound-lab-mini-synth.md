description: "Full analog legendary design by Ray Wilson."
notes: "This project is fun for someone with intermediate to advanced electronics skills who wants to make cool sounds. It makes a great first synth project but is interesting enough for the seasoned synth-diyer too. The board includes 1V/oct scale adjustment trimmers for the oscillators You will get a couple (maybe three) octaves of in tune scale."
