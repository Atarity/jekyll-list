description: "BE2NÂ is a 22HP eurorack module with two specular Benjolins at its core."
notes: "The Benjolin designed by Rob Hordijk in 2009, was a a kit to be built in educational workshops to promote synth DIY. The idea is that people can build a medium complexity electronic circuit in a controlled environment and box it later at home."
