description: "Digital hardware groovebox, with synths, samplers, effects and a sequencer with an audio looper."
notes: "The interface is flat, modular and easy to use, but most of all, it aims to encourage experimentation. The workflow is intended to be minimalistic with a minimum of menu-diving and everything at most a couple of intuitive button presses away.

The OTTO is open source (except for commercial use), and we value our community highly!Â
