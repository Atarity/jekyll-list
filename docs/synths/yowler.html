<p>Kickstarter funded project now opened. - External trigger + Diode VCA: trigger the Yowler from external gear, use it as a drum synth, built in trigger button and latch + trigger in acts as a simple vca! 4 - Oscillators and 2 XOR mixers: lots of grinding, driving sounds, osc 3 and 4 can be turned off and on. - Built in speaker + mono/stereo output: means you can use it with mono gear like guitar pedals or a modular synth, or stereo gear like mixers, headphones etc… - Pitch knobs + light dependent pitch control: get crazy sounds from the three oscillators by shining light on them.</p>
