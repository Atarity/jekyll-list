The VCO is modulated by a cheesy LFO and a simple decay envelope trigged by the piezzo cell pulse. The cell work as a pressure/hit sensor. It can be replaced by a jack to be used with any kind of trig pulses or even gates. In this case the decay pot become a Release pot.\nThere is lot's of clones available e.g.: - https://github.com/EugeneCarlo/coron-ds8-super-huevo-edition/tree/main - https://github.com/melka/Coron-DS8-Eagle ",

It makes a great first synth project but is interesting enough for the seasoned synth-diyer too. The board includes 1V/oct scale adjustment trimmers for the oscillators You will get a couple (maybe three) octaves of in tune scale.",
